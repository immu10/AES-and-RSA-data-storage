# Secure data storage using RSA and AES

A secure data storage project built to demonstrate hybrid encryption using **AES and RSA**. This system showcases how sensitive information can be encrypted, stored, and selectively accessed based on user roles. To illustrate the concept, a simplified hospital record management scenario is used, where different roles (like doctors and admins) can access encrypted records depending on their assigned permissions. The frontend is built using **Streamlit** to simulate real-time role-based access.

## Overview

This project enables secure storage and management of hospital records. Users with different roles (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Intern) have different access and write permissions. Data encryption keys persist across sessions, ensuring reliable access and enhanced security.

## Features

- Role-based authentication and authorization
- RSA + AES hybrid encryption for secure record storage
- Persistent encryption keys enabling data access across sessions
- User management with Admin control panel for creating accounts and managing permissions
- Encryption and decryption of medical records through an easy-to-use interface
- Search functionality to filter patient records by name or diagnosis
- Admin dashboard displaying system statistics and record summaries

## Usage

- **Login:** Users log in with their credentials. Admin users can create accounts and manage permissions.

- **Sign Up:** New accounts require an admin override code or admin privileges.

- **Encrypt:** Authorized users can encrypt and save new patient records.

- **Decrypt:** Users can view decrypted records based on their role and permissions.

- **Admin Panel:** Admin users can revoke user access and manage intern write permissions.

- **Dashboard:** Displays key statistics about records and users.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Main Streamlit app handling UI and routing.

- `login.py` — User authentication and role verification.

- `create_user.py` — User registration logic.

- `data.py` — Encryption and decryption functions.

- `generator.py` — Script to generate RSA keys, required to initialize keys.

- `keys/` — Folder generated by `generator.py` that stores RSA key files (not included in the repo)

- `fields.json` — Defines input fields for medical records.

- `records.txt` — Encrypted medical records storage.

- `logins.txt` — User credentials and roles storage.


## Security Notes

- The registration override code is hardcoded for demonstration and should be replaced with a secure method in production.

- User passwords and sensitive data should be stored securely (hashed and salted) — please review before deployment.

- This project is a prototype and should be audited for security before use in a real hospital environment.


##RESULTS on #MY machine
To evaluate the efficiency and scalability of the hybrid encryption system, we conducted performance tests using large synthetic datasets ranging from several megabytes to multiple records.

AES encryption/decryption throughput consistently exceeded 200 MB/s on datasets around 5–7 MB in size, demonstrating excellent symmetric encryption performance suitable for large payloads.

RSA encryption and decryption of AES keys showed minimal overhead, with typical times below 10 milliseconds per key, enabling fast secure key management across multiple user roles.

The combined two-layer envelope encryption maintained low total processing times even when encrypting and decrypting hundreds of records, confirming the system’s scalability.

Benchmarks include encryption time, decryption time, and throughput measurements to give a comprehensive view of system performance.

These results affirm that the system is capable of securing large volumes of sensitive data with strong cryptographic guarantees, while remaining performant enough for practical, real-world use.
